I am a self taught IOS developer of two years, Scala of 1 year and 6 months learn, looking for a first opportunity as a Junior IOS developer. 
After initially exploring game development using Unity and C# during the covid lockdown, in February 2021 I broke from my previous career to pursue my dream role in software development. 

My first area of study was Javascript. I completed the Jonas Schmedtmann Complete JavaScript Course, which was a great introduction into language skills and basic web applications. From there, in July 2021 I made the decision to focus on IOS development, and after discovering a particular passion for this niche it became my main goal to work in the industry. 

I worked through and completed both the App Brewery’s The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp and the iOS 15 Programming for Beginners (Ahmad Sahar and Craig Clayton) book. After working back through these modules multiple times, to build up my understanding and depth, I then worked through and completed the The Big Nerd Ranch Guide’s Swift Programming book. This delved much deeper into the Swift language, with a hardcore focus on the language itself. I felt this was the appropriate next step, having become comfortable with app development more broadly.

I decided to enhance my skillset within the industry and Scala had caught my attention. I started studying through many courses such as Rock The JVM and had also signed up to a community called Scalabridge which is ran by Noel Welsh. Here I was able to mix with people from a variety of backgrounds, I had met developers from companies such as Apple, ClearScore and Elsevier. I also attended the in person meet ups and was able to make connections with developers and companies, I gained a lot from the experience and it helped me want to stay on the path of working within software development.

I returned to Swift development as I wanted to improve my skills and began following a course by Jonathan Rasmusson which focused on building apps programmatically. I have also delved into Python, learning the fundamentals through an online course by Dr Fred Baptiste. I am also currently learning AWS and looking to gain a certification for a Foundational Cloud Practitioner, with an interest in completing further certifications at Associate level.

Understanding the need for a workplace skill set, I am also investing time into Git version control, Postgres and Objective C. I have also taken on board holistic principles such as DRY (don't repeat yourself), magic values and Separation of Concerns, and tried to carry these into my code. 

Whilst I appreciate my path has been an unconventional one, I believe this has come with some positive side effects.
With no personal tutor to call on, I have developed debugging techniques and problem solving skills over the past 2 years, often using community forums such as Stack Overflow, or parsing open source documentation.
It has also required great discipline, particularly given how daunting breaking into the industry can feel at times. For 2 years, besides a short hiatus for knee surgery I have studied 5-7 hours a day, 5 days a week. This has instilled a determination and a desire to continue learning.

IOS development has become a passion for me, and I will continue to develop different apps. Some of those I have already built can be found below in the project section, with app previews in the READMEs. I hope to find myself in a professional atmosphere that gives space for personal growth and provides an opportunity to learn and contribute. In return, I am confident I can provide a dogged work ethic, enthusiasm and an ever growing technical skillset.
