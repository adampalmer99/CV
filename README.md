I am a self taught software developer who has studied a number of programming languages and technologies: I currently have two years experience of IOS development with Swift; 18 months of Scala and the Cats library (Category Theory for functional programming); together with elementary knowledge of Javascript, C# and Unity. In conjunction with these languages, I also have an understanding of Agile and Waterfall development, and tools such as Git, Jira, AWS, and Docker.

My first area of study was Javascript. I completed the Jonas Schmedtmann Complete JavaScript Course (https://jonas.io/), which was a great introduction into language skills and basic web applications. From there, I made the decision to focus on IOS development, and after discovering a particular passion for this niche it became my main goal to work in the industry.

I worked through and completed both the London App Brewery’s 'The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp' course (https://www.appbrewery.com/p/ios13-app-development-lessons) and the iOS 15 Programming for Beginners (Ahmad Sahar and Craig Clayton) book. After working back through these modules multiple times, to build up my understanding and expertise, I then worked through and completed 'The Big Nerd Ranch Guide’s Swift Programming' book. This delved much deeper into the Swift language, with a hardcore focus on the language itself. I felt this was the logical next step, having become comfortable with app development more broadly.

I decided to reinforce and broaden my skillset within the industry by looking at different programming paradigms and Scala, as a functional rather than an object oriented language, caught my attention. I started studying and enrolling on many software courses such as 'Rock The JVM' (https://rockthejvm.com/courses), along with signing up to a community called Scalabridge (https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/), run by Noel Welsh, a widely recognised Scala expert. Here I was able to mix with people from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels, I had met developers from companies such as Apple, ClearScore and Elsevier. I also attended the in-person meet ups in London at my own expense, and was able to make connections with a number of developers and companies. I gained a lot from the experience in terms of problem solving and working in a IT setting; it also helped me firmly establish that I wanted to stay on the path of working within the exciting and ever changing industry that is, software development.

I returned to Swift and IOS development as I enjoyed the challenge and results. I also wanted to improve my skills and began following a course by Jonathan Rasmusson which focused on building apps programmatically. I have also looked into Python as it is widely used, particularly within Generative AI, learning the fundamentals through an online course by Dr Fred Baptiste. In addition, I am  currently enrolled and looking to gain certification for AWS Foundational Cloud Practitioner, with a view to progressing to completing further certifications at the Associate level.

Understanding the need for a workplace skill set, I am also investing time in understanding and using Git version control, JIRA, Scrum, Postgres and Objective C. I have also taken on board holistic principles such as DRY (don't repeat yourself), magic values, Separation of Concerns, and design patterns, and tried to carry these into the way I design and code solutions.

Whilst I appreciate my path has been unconventional, I believe this has come with many positive side effects. With no personal tutor to call on, I have had to rely on my own resourcefulness to understand and resolve issues, as they inevitably do in software, to progress. I developed debugging techniques and problem solving skills over the past 2 years, often using community forums such as Stack Overflow, or parsing open source documentation. It has also required great discipline and financial sacrifice, particularly given how daunting breaking into the industry can feel at times.

IOS development has become a passion for me, and I will continue to develop an assortment of apps. Some of those I have already built can be found below in the project section, with app previews in the READMEs. I hope to find myself in a professional environment that affords the space for personal growth and provides an opportunity to learn and contribute. In return, I am confident I can provide a strong, tenacious and honest work ethic, with enthusiasm and an ever growing technical skillset.
